                <h4>What We Do</h4>                
                <p>Project Noble provides a virtual alternative to physical poker chips for in-person Texas Hold Em games. Our service allows all players to join a game lobby on their individual devices, while we handle all chip management, side pots, and winnings calculations virtually.</p>

                    <h4>Our Mission</h4>
                    <p>We aim to make poker more accessible to all by removing barriers like complex chip calculations and the need for physical poker chips. This way, you can play poker anytime and anywhere without having to plan days in advance.</p>
