# Project Noble

## About the Project

This project is aiming to provide a virtual alternative to physical poker chips for in-person Texas Hold Em games. Users will be able to all join a game lobby on each of their devices seperately and the service will handle all of their chips, side pots, and winnings virtually. The card game will still be performed in person, but with users using their device as a chip management system.

This service is aiming to make poker more accessible to all.

## PLEASE NOTE

This service will handle NO ACTUAL TRANSFERS OF MONEY!!! It will aim to show each user how much they owe the pot/have won by the time they decide to leave the game.
